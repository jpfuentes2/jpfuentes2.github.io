tl;dr see the code <a href="https://github.com/jpfuentes2/iterated-prisoners-dilemma">here</a>.

<p>Around two years ago I began reading about functional programming and quickly became fascinated.
I dove into <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> given its emphasis on FP, dynamic typing, and Lisp origins.</p>

                  <p>I wanted to creatively express my affection for my daughter, Augusta, in a way I know best. I chose the programmng language Ruby for its flexibility and elegance. My hope is to introduce her to its boundless beauty someday soon using this composition.</p>

                  <p>If you&rsquo;re like me and use Google+ instant upload on your mobile device as a free image repository, then you&rsquo;re going to need a good way to move them around.</p>
