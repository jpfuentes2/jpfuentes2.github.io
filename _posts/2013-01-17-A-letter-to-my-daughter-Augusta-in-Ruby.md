I wanted to creatively express my affection for my daughter, Augusta, in a way I know best. I chose programmng language Ruby for its flexibility and elegance. My hope is to introduce her to its boundless beauty someday soon using this composition.

This is a real, working, program which outputs "Augusta, we &lt;3 you!" when executed. Be sure to read the [love.rb](https://github.com/jpfuentes2/a-letter-to-Augusta/blob/master/love.rb) file below which supports the letter’s syntax. I tried to keep it symmetrical and legible so that the source closely resembles the letter’s content.
